# sql-challenge

# SQL Challenge:

1. Establish a fresh repository for the project, naming it "sql-challenge." Ensure that this assignment is not incorporated into any pre-existing repositories.

2. 
Duplicate the recently created repository onto your local computer by executing the clone command.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the SQL challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: EmployeeSQL.

4. Add your files to this folder.

5.Push the above changes to GitHub. 
 ## Background:


For this task, your responsibilities encompass designing tables to accommodate data from CSVs, importing the CSVs into a SQL database, and responding to inquiries about the data. In essence, you'll be engaged in:

1. Data Modeling
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Analysis

## Data Modeling:
Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Feel free to use a tool like

## Data Engineering:


Leverage the available information to formulate a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Ensure to define data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and any other necessary constraints.

Subsequently, import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.

# Data Analysis:

Upon establishing a comprehensive database, perform the following tasks:

1. Enumerate the details of each employee, including employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. Compile a list of employees hired in the year 1986.

3. Compile a list of department managers with details such as department number, department name, manager's employee number, last name, first name, and employment start and end dates.

4. Present the department information for each employee, including employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Identify all employees with the first name "Hercules" and last names starting with "B."

6. Display a roster of employees in the Sales department, featuring their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. Present a list of employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. Arrange a frequency count of employee last names in descending order, indicating how many employees share each last name.

# Submission:
* Create an image file of your ERD.

* Create a .sql file of your table schemata.

* Create a .sql file of your queries.
